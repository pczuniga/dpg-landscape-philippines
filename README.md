# Digital Public Goods Landscape Analysis

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]](LICENSE.md)

The Philippine UNICEF Country Office together with the Digital Public Goods Alliance has partnered to make the Philippines as one of the DPG pathfinding countries. One of the work being done is the development of a landscape analysis of existing and potential open source solutions locally. 

## About this Landscape Analysis

### Digital Public Goods

#### What is a Digital Public Good?

Digital Public Goods (DPG) are digital products, in form of software, algorithms, data sets, AI models, standards and even content that are open source and can contribute to the attainment of sustainable development goals. In the article *Building Public Goods for the 21st Century,* Nicholas Gruen wrote about the concept of digital artifacts, like websites, algorithms or even programming languages are all potential public goods since they are costless to replicate.

In the economic sense of goods, a DPG is both **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous**.  ****A DPG in non-excludable in a sense because it is something that is assumed to be open source, hence no limitation must be done on the use, modification and adoption of the DPG. It should always be assumed as *free*. At the same time a DPG is also non-rivalrous because, given that it is a digital tool, and there a general assumption that digital products are virtually limitless, save for limitations in hardware or storage, using a DPG won’t hinder other from using the same DPG as well. 

The United Nations have embraced the use of DPGs in its various work. It promotes a global effort to encourage countries in both investing in the creation of DPGs and in the reusing of existing DPGs. The following document shows the roadmap of the UN Secretary General for Digital Cooperation on the Promotion of Digital Public Goods ([https://www.un.org/techenvoy/sites/www.un.org.techenvoy/files/general/Digital_Public_Goods_Summary_PDF.pdf](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/sites/www.un.org.techenvoy/files/general/Digital_Public_Goods_Summary_PDF.pdf))

To further support the promotion and the call to invest on digital public goods, a workplan has been developed by the UN to ensure that concrete action is done towards the adoption of DPGs. The key activities of the workplan are as follows:

1.1 Holding a series of events to establish a general understanding of the digital public goods definition presented by the UNSG in the Roadmap and the accompanying more operational DPG Standard.

1.2 Working with the Digital Public Goods Alliance and other initiatives including New America Foundation, and GitHub, OSI, IEEE, Linux Foundation, Software Freedom Conservancy, BMGF, Creative Commons and PIJIP at American University, Digital Square, and Digital Impact Alliance Open Source Center, to establish broad endorsement of the Standard

1.3 Producing a short paper, in collaboration with the Digital Public Goods Alliance, on the standard for digital public goods and open source digital solutions

2.1 Development/Expansion of the Alliance’s platform

2.2 Playing a facilitating role between the Alliance and other initiatives in exploring and establishing potential collaborations

2.3 Promoting the work being done to advance DPGs, including that of the Alliance to relevant parties, including Member States

3.1 Holding a series of open consultations and events on identifying human rights implications for digital public goods and potential governance frameworks

3.2 Working with the Alliance and human rights groups to monitor the development and use of digital public goods (2) promoting good governance and human rights through digital public goods

4.1. Identify existing financial models, including government and philanthropic funds and “independent” funds for and from the open-source community through a paper/online resource

4.2. Collaborating with the Alliance, country governments and relevant actors in the ecosystem to publish case based learnings and “best practice” guidelines, for how governments and other stakeholders can approach and expand their use, and promotion of digital public goods

4.3. Promoting the expansion of funds available, both revenue and grant model, for development and deployment of digital public goods to ensure sustainability of such goods

4.4. Capacity building for regional and local level governments and civil societies to be able to use digital public goods

4.5. Establish best practice and promote success stories, for instance, examples of successful stewardship of a DPG project which includes governance policies.

5.1. Conduct research to identify general and specific use cases of various open-source, open content and open data within the UN system, leveraging on existing work done on use cases

5.2. Drafting of guidelines for using digital public goods, including the development of licensing recommendations that meet the needs of the use cases referred to above, leveraging on existing work done

5.3. Partnership with the open-source community, civil society and private sector, and existing training programs to create modules for UN staff and personnel, including UNV 5.4. Consider other key areas of engagement and possible initiatives where there can be synergies with the DPG agenda, including in areas such as digital public infrastructure and ICT building blocks.
